How to Install Models
This procedure can be followed for adding models to new 
schematic files as well as adding models to schematic 
files that have already been started.


1. Once the model library and symbol library are saved 
to disk, open the PSpice Schematic Editor. Select Analysis, 
and then select Library and Include Files. 


2. Select Browse to look for the Model Library that 
contains the model that is to be used in the schematic; 
open the Model Library; select Add Library and then OK.

Add Library adds the Model Library to the list of Library 
Files to be used in the schematic that is currently open.

Add Library* should be selected if this Model Library is 
to be used in all schematics. 


3. Next, select Draw and then Get New Part. Under Part Name, 
type the name of the part that is to be added to the 
schematic. Select Place and Close to add the part to the 
schematic.


The part is now ready to be used in the Schematic Editor.
